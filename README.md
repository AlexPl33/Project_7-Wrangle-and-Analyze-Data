# Project 7: Wrangle and Analyze Data

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

## What software do I need
The following packages (libraries) need to be installed:

* pandas
* NumPy
* requests
* tweepy
* json
